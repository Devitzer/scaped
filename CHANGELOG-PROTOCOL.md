The system for how the Changelogs work.

The main changelog is for *stable*, approved updates to the main part of Scaped. <br>
This is the one you will want to use in production.

The next changelog is for *unstable* updates, they are tested in development, but not in production. <br>
This is the one you will want to use if you are developing or want early access to the newest updates with the consequence of potentially having some features be not useable. You can also use this to see the newest upcoming changes, so you are prepared to adapt upon the production release. (to release compatible versions of your plugins ASAP)
